# Better Coding Academy Style Guide

<!-- omit in toc -->
## What is this?

This is a non-exhaustive set of coding principles you are expected to follow whilst studying at Better Coding Academy.

I personally follow this style guide for all production code that I write, so feel free to use it / extend from it in any of your production projects as well.

<!-- omit in toc -->
## Why use a style guide?

Having a consistent coding style across your projects is one of the easiest ways to keep coding quality and interoperability high. Learning to be consistent and follow the style guide of a company (hopefully they have one) pays handsome dividends.

## General Rules

### Indentation

**No tabs.** Instead, tabs should be remapped to insert two spaces. Tabs are not consistently rendered across programs and operating systems, sometimes having a width of 4, and sometimes even a width of 8, which is why using spaces that appear like tabs works best.

### Quotes

**Use double quotes.**

**Are there situations in which using single quotes is appropriate?** Yes, absolutely. See below under the [JavaScript](#javascript) heading for more information.

### Editor

It is suggested that you use VSCode for writing code.

**Why?** Well, as a non-exhaustive list, VSCode:

1. Supports a multiitude of extensions;
2. Has great customisability and extensibility;
3. Supports WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux); and
4. Is faster than Atom (which used to be my editor of choice).

### Formatter

The use of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is **highly recommended**, as it would help automatically enforce a number of the rules presented within this document.

## HTML

### Tags

All tag names must be valid HTML tags (unless otherwise supported through the use of custom HTML elements).

```html
<!-- good -->
<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>I am a paragraph</p>

<!-- bad -->
<cool-heading>Yo</cool-heading>
```

All tag names must strictly be lowercase.

```html
<!-- good -->
<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>I am a paragraph</p>

<!-- bad -->
<H1>Hello</H1>
<P>I am a paragraph</p>
```

All self-closing tags must have a space and `/>` after all attributes.

```html
<!-- good -->
<img src="image.jpg" />
<br />

<!-- bad -->
<img src="image.jpg">
<img src="image.jpg"></img>
<img src="image.jpg"/>
```

Non-self-closing tags must **not** self-close.

```html
<!-- good -->
<p>Hello</p>

<!-- bad -->
<p />
```

### Attributes

All attributes must strictly be in alphabetical order.

```html
<!-- good -->
<input placeholder="Username" size="10" type="text" value="foo" />

<!-- bad -->
<input type="text" placeholder="Username" value="foo" size="10" />
```

All attributes must be valid HTML attributes in their valid lowercase form, or otherwise be preceded by `data-`.

```html
<!-- good -->
<img data-image-for="myPage" src="image.jpg" />
<button onclick="doSomething();">Click Me</button>

<!-- bad -->
<img image-for="myPage" src="image.jpg" />
<button onClick="doSomething();">Click Me</button>
```

## CSS

### Selectors

Don't use anything other than class names and tag names for selecting.

Class name selectors must use kebab-case.

**What about IDs?** IDs are reserved for selection purposes in JavaScript.

**What about attributes?** They're allowed, but only in tandem with an appropriate tag name. For example:

```css
/* good */
input[type="text"] {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* bad */
[type="text"] {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

The value in an attribute selector must be surrounded by double quotes.

```css
/* good */
input[type="text"] {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* bad */
input[type=text] {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

### Declaration Blocks

The formatting must be as follows:

```css
<selector> {
  /* two spaces from the left */
  <declarations>
}
```

Every declaration block must be separated from other blocks (and `@import` statements) by a new line.

```css
/* good */
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&display=swap");

body {
  font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;
}

.body {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* bad */
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&display=swap");
body {
  font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;
}
.body {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Tag-based declaration blocks go first, and then class names.

```css
/* good */
body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

.bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* bad */
.bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}

body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

### Declarations

Declarations must be in alphabetical order.

```css
/* good */
.square {
  background-color: red;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100px;
}

/* bad */
.square {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
}
```

Where possible, try not to use vendor prefixes; instead use a CSS preprocessor to add them for you where possible. However, if you were to add vendor prefixes, add them prior to their associated property, in alphabetical order.

```css
/* good */
.custom-select {
  -moz-appearance: none;
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
  background-color: green;
  -moz-border-radius: 5px;
  -webkit-border-radius: 5px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```

If you are using a vendor prefix without the "normal" version of the declaration, put it where it would belong if it did not have the vendor prefix.

```css
/* good */
.funky-text {
  -webkit-background-clip: text; /* "clip" before "image" */
  background-image: url(image.jpg);
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;  /* "text" after "back" */
}
```

### Miscellaneous

**Try not to use `!important`.** `!important` is needed in only a very small percentage of use cases. In most other cases, simply reordering your CSS declarations can do the trick. CSS declarations of the same specificity level are applied in a top-down fashion, so if you want a style to take precedence, simply try moving it further down instead of using `!important`.

**Try not to use `z-index`.** Instead of using `z-index`, in the large majority of cases you can simply reorder elements. For example:

```html
<style>
  .square {
    position: absolute;
  }
</style>

<div class="square">square 1</div>
<div class="square">square 2</div>
<div class="square">square 3</div>
<div class="square">square 4</div>
```

Square 4 will naturally be on top of Square 3, which will be on top of Square 2, and so on.

## JavaScript

### Variables

**Never use `var`.** This ensures that you canâ€™t reassign your references, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.

```js
// good
const number = 5;

// bad
var number = 5;
```

**Use `let` only where absolutely necessary.** Just like with `var`, this prevents unnecessary assignments.

```js
// good
const number = 5;
let someComplexValue;
if (condition) {
  doSomething();
  doSomethingElse();
  someComplexValue = doAnotherThing();
} else {
  doSomethingElse();
  someComplexValue = doSomething();
}

// bad
let number = 5;
```

### Objects

All object properties must be in alphabetical order.

```js
// good
const bill = {
  age: 25,
  email: "bill@example.com",
  name: "Bill"
}

// bad
const bill = {
  name: "Bill",
  age: 25,
  email: "bill@example.com"
};
```

**Why?** It doesn't make much of a difference for smaller objects; however, when you end up with more properties, such as in the following example:

```js
const options = {
  autoFocus: true,
  disabled: isSubmitting && isValid,
  displaySize: "lg",
  id: generateId("email"),
  name: "email",
  placeholder: "e.g. lucas@example.com",
  type: "text"
};
```

Assuming you know your alphabet, locating a property is simply a matter of binary search, i.e. O(log n). However, if we were to let the programmer do "whatever order feels right for them at the time", then we would get something like:

```js
const options = {
  id: generateId("email"),
  name: "email",
  displaySize: "lg",
  type: "text",
  placeholder: "e.g. lucas@example.com",
  autoFocus: true,
  disabled: isSubmitting && isValid
};
```

As it becomes harder to read, some programmers would then start adding pointless new lines, grouping once again "as they see fit":

```js
const options = {
  // no one
  id: generateId("email"),
  name: "email",

  // has any idea
  displaySize: "lg",
  type: "text",

  // why these are grouped like this
  placeholder: "e.g. lucas@example.com",
  autoFocus: true,
  disabled: isSubmitting && isValid
};
```

So yeah, no good. Finding a property in an unordered object is O(n), an order of magnitude worse than O(log n).

### Functions

Use arrow functions where possible. Use the `function` keyword only when you need the `this` value.

**Why?** Arrow functions are shorter and give a more intuitive understanding of `this`. `this` should be reserved for use in specific situations instead of having every function have its own "accidental" `this` value.

```js
// good
const add = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;

const handleSubmit = async ({ name }) => {
  const result = await addUser({ variables: { name }});
  return result.data;
}

input.addEventListener("keydown", function (evt) { 
  evt.preventDefault();

  alert(`Hello ${this.value}!`);
});

// bad
function add(num1, num2) {
  return nume + num2;
}

async function handleSubmit({ name }) {
  const result = await addUser({ variables: { name }});
  return result.data;
}
```

When definining the parameters of a function/method, **one object parameter is generally preferable to multiple arguments**.

For example, instead of this:

```js
// bad
class User {
  constructor(id, name, email, address) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
    this.address = address;
  }
}
```

Do this:

```js
// good
class User {
  constructor({ address, email, id, name }) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
    this.address = address;
  }
}
```

This has three main benefits:

1. **It easily allows for properties to be optional.** Imagine if `email` were to be optional; creating an object using the first syntax would look like:

    ```js
    new User(1, "Lucas", undefined, "1 Main St.");
    ```

    However, for the second one it would simply be:

    ```js
    new User({
      address: "1 Main St.",
      // notice how we leave out email entirely
      id: 1,
      name: "Lucas"
    });
    ```

2. **It removes the ambiguity of ordering.** In the first example, there is no real reason to use the order `id, name, email, address` as opposed to, say, `id, name, address, email`, or any other combination really. When using an object and destructuring it, it is easier than remembering an arbitrary order.
3. **It gives each "argument" a name.** Obviously in the second example we only have one argument (an object); however, each one of those properties has a name, which adds incredible semantics into your funciton. Look at the difference between these two:

    ```php
    // actual PHP code... yikes
    $canvas = imagecreatetruecolor(200, 200);

    // yikes
    $pink = imagecolorallocate($canvas, 255, 105, 180);
    $white = imagecolorallocate($canvas, 255, 255, 255);
    $green = imagecolorallocate($canvas, 132, 135, 28);

    // yikes
    imagerectangle($canvas, 50, 50, 150, 150, $pink);
    imagerectangle($canvas, 45, 60, 120, 100, $white);
    imagerectangle($canvas, 100, 120, 75, 160, $green);
    ```

    Using what we've just learned, what if we rewrite this a little?

    ```js
    const canvas = imageCreateTrueColor({ height: 200, width: 200 });

    const pink = imageColorAllocate({
      blue: 180,
      canvas,
      green: 105,
      red: 255
    });
    const white = imageColorAllocate({
      blue: 255,
      canvas,
      green: 255,
      red: 255
    });
    const green = imageColorAllocate({
      blue: 28,
      canvas,
      green: 135,
      red: 132
    });

    imageRectangle({
      canvas,
      color: pink,
      x1: 50,
      x2: 150,
      y1: 50,
      y2: 150
    });
    imageRectangle({
      canvas,
      color: white,
      x1: 45,
      x2: 120,
      y1: 60,
      y2: 100
    });
    imageRectangle({
      canvas,
      color: green,
      x1: 100,
      x2: 75,
      y1: 120,
      y2: 160
    });
    ```

    Yes, it is longer; however, look at all the additional information that is now available. No need to remember the order of parameters, and that is a huge deal. It might take 20% longer to type the first time round, but each time a change is made, the reduction in amiguity will save much more than the original 20% cost.

### Quotes

Use double quotes `""` for strings.

```js
// good
const message = "Hello!";

// bad
const message = 'Hello!';
```

However, if you wish to embed double quotes in your string, you can use single quotes or backticks - avoid escaping where possible.

```js
// good
const message = 'And then he said "Hello", like a maniac!';
const message = `And then he said "Hello", like a maniac!`;

// bad
const message = "And then he said \"Hello\", like a maniac!";
```

Use backticks whenever you need to interpolate a value into your string.

```js
// bad
console.log("How are you, " + name + "?");
console.log(["How are you, ", name, "?"].join());

// good
console.log(`How are you, ${name}?`);
```

### Spacing

Put one new line before and after every function in your code (unless there's no code before/after it).

```js
// good
function func1() {
  // something
}

function func2() {
  // something else
}

// bad
function func1() {
  // something
}
function func2() {
  // something else
}
```

Put one new line before and after every method and property in your class (unless it's at the start/end of your class).

```js
// good
class Form extends Component {
  state = { a: 1, b: 2 };

  handleChange = () => {
    // ...
  }

  render() {
    // ...
  }
}

// bad
class Form extends Component {
  state = { a: 1, b: 2 };
  handleChange = () => {
    // ...
  }
  render() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Loops

Try not to use `for` loops where possible. Instead, consider using Array iteration methods, e.g. `Array.prototype.forEach` or `Array.prototype.map`.

**Why?** Specificity and clarity. When you see a `.map` method, assuming no crazy stuff is going on, you know that a new array is being generated from an existing array. When you see a `.forEach` method, you know that it is iterating thorugh properties, and so on and so forth for `.reduce`, `.some`, `.every`, etc. - every single method is clearly defined for a particular purpose.

However when you see a `for` loop, there is no guarantee for what is going to happen, and in many cases, when it tries to do more than one thing, the loop quickly becomes overcomplicated and poorly designed.

```js
const names = ["Aaron", "Amanda", "Arthur"];

// good
names.forEach(name => {
  console.log(name);
})

const namesInCaps = names.map(name => name.toUpperCase());

// bad
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
  console.log(name);  
}
```

However, there are some cases in which you will need to use `for` loops. In such cases, you should use a proper counter name (not `i`) where possible. However, using a generic name like `i` is okay if you are only repeating something a certain number of times, and do not plan to use the index for any purposes.

### Switch Statements

Try to use `switch` statements as little as possible.

**Why?** They're essentially `if` statements that sacrifice flexibility for a little bit more minimalism (and even that is debatable).

For example, look at the following code:

```js
const status = "GO";
switch (status) {
  case "GO":
    console.log("Let's go!");
    break;
  case "STOP":
    console.log("Time to stop!");
    break;
}
```

And its equivalent using `if` statements:

```js
const status = "GO";
if (status === "GO") {
  console.log("Let's go!");
} else if (status === "STOP") {
  console.log("Time to stop!");
}
```

I mean... it's 3 lines shorter - I guess the only thing is that `status` is not repeated. However, going back to the `switch` statement, what if you want to have some more granular control?

```js
const status = "GO";
const car = "RACECAR";
switch (status) {
  case "GO":
    console.log("Let's go!");
    break;
  case "STOP":
    // yikes
    if (car === "RACECAR") {
      console.log("Let's GO!");
    } else {
      console.log("Time to stop!");
    }
    break;
}
```

Compared to if we were using `if` statements:

```js
const status = "GO";
const car = "RACECAR";
if (status === "GO") {
  console.log("Let's go!");
} else if (status === "STOP" && car === "RACECAR") {
  console.log("Let's GO!");
} else if (status === "STOP") {
  console.log("Time to stop!");
}
```

**Are there cases in which using a switch statement is appropriate?** Sure! Well, maybe... I don't know. At the lowest level it's a matter of personal preference; however, hopefully you can see why I do not advocate its widespread use.

### DOM Operations

Try to update the DOM as little as possible.

**Why?** Updating the DOM is "slow". Slow, as in relatively slow compared to updating internal JavaScript variables. In other words:

```js
someHTMLElement.innerText = "Hello"; // this
someVariable = "Hello";              // is slower than this
```

Compare the following two bits of code that do essentially the same thing:

```js
const preTag = document.createElement("pre");
document.body.appendChild(preTag);

// bad
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  preTag.innerText += `${Math.random()}\n`; // in total, 100 DOM update operations
}

// good
let preTagContents = preTag.innerText; // store the value (DOM access operation)
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  preTagContents += `${Math.random()}\n`; // update the variable - much faster...
}
preTag.innerText = preTagContents; // and write it into the DOM! (a single DOM update operation)
```
